# ðŸ¤” Giving a TEDx Talk

## What is a TEDx Talk?

TEDx talks are about new, bold, and evocative ideas. It's our motto: _ideas worth spreading_. Our parent organization, TEDx, sums this up wonderfully in their article [_**What is a TEDx Talk?**_](https://www.ted.com/participate/organize-a-local-tedx-event/tedx-organizer-guide/speakers-program/what-is-a-tedx-talk) _**Go on... take a read!**_

## What should I leave out of my talk?

When giving a TEDx talk, it should be about spreading ideas, but doing so in a way that doesn't have a commercial, religious, or political agenda. It's vital that you consider the [**TEDx Content Guidelines**](https://www.ted.com/participate/organize-a-local-tedx-event/tedx-organizer-guide/speakers-program/prepare-your-speaker/tedx-content-guidelines-details) before your approach one of our curators with your talk idea or script. Having such content will immediately disqualify you as a speaker.
