## PowerPoint Slides

### Considerations

If you'd like to use slides (they're _entirely optional_!), consider slides you've seen in the past... Have some caught your eye? Distracted you from the talk? Been easy to understand or too crowded to look at? When creating the preliminary draft for your slides, it's important to consider that (although your slides will undergo an iteration by our Technical Production team), your talk must be supported by your slide content... not hindered or overpowered by them. If something isn't necessary, don't include it. Think about how you'll click through your slides as you talk. If something is important, but you don't know how to make it clean, let us know!&#x20;

### Requirements

* Use PowerPoint or Keynote. Don't use online services like Canva or Prezi
* Use slides that are widescreen (16:9 aspect ratio). PowerPoint and Keynote should default to this setting
* Use a black slide background whenever possible
* _**KEEP IT SIMPLE!**_ Don't put too much text or too many images on any one slide.
* We will update your slides to use the [Inter](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter?query=inter) or [Inter Tight](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter+Tight?query=inter) font family. Consider designing them with these fonts from the start, if you're comfortable installing the fonts (they're free)
* Don't include animations or transitions other than simple fades, wipes, or Morph/Magic Move
* Understand that your slides **will be edited** from your original designs by our team to ensure they follow both our content guidelines and style guidelines. We will run your slides by you with the updated slides to ensure you're comfortable with the deck

## Video

Video content can be amazingly captivating! Note that video should be used to support and demonstrate what you're speaking about, rather than _replacing_ you as a speaker. If the video is explaining a concept instead of you, it's likely not a good fit for your talk. However, a short video to illustrate an example can really help the audience visualise your point. If you're interested in including a video in your TEDx talk, let us know!



## Live Music, Performance, or Visual Art

Audience members love when performers include a live experience on stage! Whether that be a musical performance, dance number, or a live painting session, we'd love to support whatever creative juices you have flowing. Because of logistical requirements, please let us know at least 1 month before the conference that you'd like to include this in your talk. This way, our Technical Production team has time to have everything ready for you!
