# ðŸ’» Slides & A/V

## First Consider: Is It Needed?

Slides, videos, performances, live music, tech demos... the list goes on! These are wonderful complements to your talk if you want to illustrate a point. However, these complements _should never become supplements_ for your talk. There have been hundreds of TED Talks done without any slide deck. Consider whether the audience gains anything from having one... or if it just distracts from your idea.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Slides, videos, etc. are never to help _you._ You should be able to present without these aids. It's to help _the audience._ Keep this in mind as you make your talk.
{% endhint %}



## PowerPoint Slides

### Considerations

Again, slides are **entirely optional!** Lots of TED Talks happen without them. If you do decide to build slides, it's important to remember that: **your talk and idea are centre stage**. While building the slides, continually ask yourself:

* Will this _help the audience_? If not, don't include it.
* Will this be distracting? Will it detract from your speaking?
* What _actually_ do I want to emphasise here? Does my slide support that?

If something **isn't necessary, don't include it.** A blank slide is as powerful as a slide with content. Think about **how you'll click through your slides** as you talk.

### Notes

* **Use PowerPoint or Keynote.**&#x20;
  * DO NOT use online services such as Google Slides, Canva, or Prezi.&#x20;
  * If you use Linux, you may save LibreOffice files in .pptx format or use [PowerPoint Online](https://powerpoint.cloud.microsoft/) or [Keynote on iCloud.com](https://www.icloud.com/keynote/).
* Use a black slide background whenever possible.
* Our team will **provide comments** on your initial slide drafts and **make edits** to your final version for clarity, brand identity, compliance, and legal reasons.

## Video

Video content can be amazingly captivating! Note that video should be used to support and demonstrate what you're speaking about, rather than _replacing_ you as a speaker. If the video is explaining a concept instead of you, it's likely not a good fit for your talk. However, a short video to illustrate an example can really help the audience visualise your point. If you're interested in including a video in your TEDx talk, let us know!



## Live Music, Performance, or Visual Art

Audience members love when performers include a live experience on stage! Whether that be a musical performance, dance number, or a live painting session, we'd love to support whatever creative juices you have flowing.

Please let us know **at least 1 month before the conference** that you'd like to include this in your talk. This way, our Technical Production team has time to have everything ready for you!
