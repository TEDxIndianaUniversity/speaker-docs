# ðŸ¤˜ Working with Us

## What is a Curator?

Curators are members of TEDxIndianaUniversity, a 100% student-run organization, that will help you along your path to conference day! They will have conversations with you about your ideas, read and make suggestions on your speech drafts, and even help out on the day of the conference. These students are dedicated to ensuring that your inspirational ideas make it to the stage!&#x20;

## Mutual Understanding

We believe in transparency. This includes creating an atmosphere of respect and rapport between you, your curator, and our student organization! As such, we'd like like to make you aware of the ways in which we operate, so you are prepared for what to expect:

* We are 100% undergraduate student run: entirely unpaid, without an advisor, and passionate to spread inspirational ideas. Because academics can be demanding, we'll sometimes need a day or two to respond to your messages. We appreciate your understanding and hope to afford the same to you (as we're sure that you're also quite busy)!
* We operate entirely as a non-profit. As such, we work with funding boards and other institutions to make your TEDx Talk possible. We're proud to be what is often rare: a financially stable student organization. We will likely cover much of your travel and lodging expenses, so long as they're reasonable. However, because we work within the bureaucracy of our University and within TED guidelines, we apologise in advance if processing financials and reimbursements takes more time than desired.
